# VICE: View-invariant chess estimation

This repository contains annotated data for 4 chess matches. The folder names in the data folder correspond to the Youtube IDs of the matches. Each match contains two files:
1. `annotations.xml` contains bounding boxes of the pieces being moved, before and after the move, for each move.
2. `moves.txt` contains the true moves of each match.
